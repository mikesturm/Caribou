##Chapter 3


The sound of the train’s brakes woke Nik up abruptly. He wasn’t sure how long he’d been sleeping, but given that the train was stopped at a station, and the sign read ‘Lancaster’. This was his stop, and the last one before the train turned around, and headed back down south. That meant that Nik had been sleeping for about an hour and a half. He quickly got up out of his seat and grabbed his suitcase from the floor under the seat in front of him. He looked out the window. There wasn’t anyone else getting off at the station, and the station itself appeared to be closed already. And at once, Nik remembered what he had missed about rural life; you could have a train station that closed at 5pm, and no one would think twice about it. That was just how things were up here.
As he shuffled through the aisle toward the door, he began to feel the dread roll over him. Though a 25 mile walk had sounded good to him when, full of free coffee by way of having purchased 10 cups prior and getting his card punched, he vowed to himself that he wouldn’t take a taxi from the train station to the farm, in the light of the exhausting train ride, the prospect of walking around 7 hours did not quite appeal to him. With that heavy realization coming to rest on his shoulders, he slouched them as he stepped off the train. The air was warm and humid, much more than he expected for early May in far north Minnesota. The Lancaster station was truly a relic of a bygone era. 
Of all the years that Nik had been up to Caribou, he had never come through this way. He alway came by way of his parents’ Ford Explorer, the one that they kept for nearly his entire childhood, until he was old enough to drive it, at which time the front end promptly separated from the rest of vehicle as he drove to his first date. That was that for the Explorer. He never even got to make out in its fairly roomy, make-out friendly back seat. But such is life; short bursts of pleasure, tainted with the bitter failings of all the things constantly in the process of falling apart. And speaking of falling apart, that seems to be what exactly one half of the Lancaster train station was doing. The station was a brick station, with an oversized roof that almost seemed to reach over the tracks, to give patrons cover from the elements as they awaited their ride. It was all brick, a faded red color, with a khaki colored mortar between the bricks. The main entrance was impressive; a semi-circle with two large, heavy-looking wooden doors obviously made from ancient trees. Large bright brass hinges were attached to the doors at the top and bottom of each, with large nails pounded in them. The roof was, curiously enough, made of wooden shingles, which on the southern side were gray and old, but clearly in impeccable structural condition. But on the northern half, the shingles were faded, cracked, had moss on them, and generally looked as if they had little life left in them. This started at almost exactly above where the two doors met in the main entrance, directly in the center of the small station, making it look like two stations—one old and dying, the other new and full of life—had been joined together seamlessly as one structure. This was all punctuated by a tall spire that rose from the center of the roof, like a projectile that had been tossed up through the building from below. It consisted of three arches on each of the four sides, formed by two small pillars and the two corner pillars, made of what looked like stone. The tall, sloped roof of the spire was an unmistakable oxidized copper green, but looked regal, pointing upward toward the hidden sun. Somehow, time and the elements had conspired to perfectly coordinate the severe aging of the northern half of the station, and perfectly preserve the southern half.
As Nik shuffled further on to the platform, he looked at his wrist, where a watch would normally have been. He suddenly remembered that he had not bothered to take his watch with him. Something about not needing to be subservient to time, he recalled. He sighed as County Road 4 came into view. It’s not like knowing what time it was would really help him out anyway. The walk would be roughly 7 hours, less if he channelled his inner mall-dwelling senior-citizen and speed-walked to the farm.
But before he could even make his way off of the platform to the road, Nik heard a voice from the other side of the platform.

“Nik!” someone yelled.

As Nik looked back, he could see that it was Harris. He didn’t have his coat or his briefcase with him. He was just holding what appeared to be a map, and waving it as he looked on to make sure that Nik had heard him. When he saw that Nik did see and hear him, he began an incredibly fast, but composed walk toward him. Within seconds he was in front of Nik.

“I’m glad I caught you,” Harris said, amazingly not at all out of breath from his brisk walk across the platform. “As I got of the train, I felt that I couldn’t in good conscience let you walk all the way to Caribou; not in this hot sun, and down the dusty road.”

“It’s not an issue, really,” Nik insisted, or rather, half-insisted, as the prospect of not having to walk for what was basically a full workday no longer seemed in any way desirable.

“Aw, c’mon. You’re really going to try to stand there—already sweating—and tell me that you’re okay to spend the next God-knows-how-many hours walking down some country road?!” Harris turned and pointed at a sleek, black vehicle parked on the north side of the station, “you’d be doing me a favor letting me give you a ride.”

Nik was still for a second—both mentally and physically. At this point, he *really* didn’t want to walk; it was just a stupid idea to begin with, and another example of his past self putting his future self in a terrible condition for some supposed and not well thought out character building. He replayed the conversation he had with Harris on the train, and while disconcerting, to be sure, no warning bells went off. Harris was the ultimate extrovert, but didn’t at all seem harmful. “Okay,” Nik conceded. “If you have room, I’ll take a ride.”

“Excellent!” Harris exclaimed, clapping his hands together firmly, but quitely as if the roulette ball had just landed on his number, but he did not want to attract the attention of the pit boss. “I’ll take your suitcase, if that’s okay.”

“Uh, yeah, sure,” Nik responded.

With that, Harris swept up Nik’s suitcase and began a brisk walk toward his car. Nik had to speed up a bit to keep pace with him, especially since Harris was about 5 inches or so taller than him. 

As Nik caught up with him, he (nearly panting) asked, “Is this all because I gave you that dollar?” Nik asked half-jokingly.

Harris laughed, “Well, sure! Consider it services rendered!”

As they arrived at Harris’s car, it beeped and flashed its headlights to indicate that it was unlocking. It was an impressive vehicle, a sleek black Land Rover, with matte silver rims that featured impossibly thin spokes. It sat fairly high off the ground, and the trim was all matte black, in contrast with the glossy black of the rest of the body. Harris opened the back gate and placed Nik’s suitcase inside. As he closed it, he motioned for Nik to climb into the passenger’s side, and reassured him, “You don’t have to wait for me to get in. Go ahead.”

So, Nik climbed in. The inside of the vehicle looked even sleeker than the outside. The leather was black with dark mahogany trim. The same leather bound the dashboard, glovebox, and center console. The windshield was expansive, and gave a view like what Nik recalled the *USS Enterprise* having in *Star Trek: The Next Generation*, which his grandmother had for some reason watched religiously when he was young. Though the vehicle looked sleek and modern in every way, there was one surprising feature that wasn’t modern; there were no digital displays to be found. The spedometer, odometor, radio, climate controls, and everything else was analog—knobs, dials, and meters all the way around. 

“So, while I have offered you a ride, and I will certainly be driving,” Harris said as if he were striking a deal, “I *will* need you to navigate. I have been to Caribou exactly once, but I couldn’t tell you how the hell to get there from here.”

Nik, still adjusting from the shock of serendipity, as well as that sick feeling he often got from the good nature and generosity of strangers, forced a reply, “Uh, it’s basically just following County Road 4, for a while, and then there’s a tree I have to look for…,” Nik paused looking down at an imaginary map resting somewhere between his knees and his shoes. He broke back into his incomplete sentence, “...a big weeping willow tree—one with a limb that looks like it was tied in a knot.”

“Well,” Harris said, smiling and looking at Nik satisfied, “it’s good enough to know where you’re going, even better to know how to get there.”

Nik forced an awkward laugh, and some sort of half-audible agreement. With that, Harris turned the key in the ignition, and the engine roared to life. Harris shifted the gear into drive, and zoomed out of the gravel parking lot, leaving a cloud of dust behind them. Harris turned the air conditioning up to full blast, which was refreshing at first. However, after about 10 minutes of driving, Nik began to feel like he was outside on a gray winter day without a jacket. He didn’t dare say anything to Harris; he just didn’t feel comfortable enough. This was classic Nik. Get into a situation where someone is helping, stumble awkwardly through conversation, suffer through whatever idiosyncratic behavior rears its ugly head without so much as voicing a differing preference. To risk offending someone else in person—even to assert his own discomfort, to validate his feelings—was just too much for Nik to bear. He viewed it as the gentlemanliness of a bygone era, which he alone was carrying on. If you were to ask his last girlfriend, she would say she considered it utterly unbearable.
As the two men traveled up the road, the sound of the air caressing the cabin of the vehicle began to lull Nik to sleep. He never did well staying awake in cars, and as a matter of fact, had a similar problem even on the driver’s side of vehicles. His freshman year, after only a handful of times driving from home to school, he managed to nod off on the interstate just long enough that his car veered out of th left lane and into the shallow grassy ditch that separated the eastbound from the westbound lanes. He quickly regained consciousness, turned the wheel, applied the brakes, and ended up swerving onto the westbound lanes, facing oncoming cars travelling at 65, 75, 85 miles per hour. With headlights bearing down on him, and the three passengers he had volunteered to take home with him yelling loudly, he somehow—perhaps by the hand of fate that he refused to espouse a belief in—careened back onto the eastbound lane’s left-most shoulder. He shifted the car slowly into park, and turned around with a look of sheer terror, mixed with unbridled amazement, looking more *through* his passengers than *at *them. They replied with various curses, exclamations, and fits of begging for explanation. Nik himself, merely unbuckled his seatbelt, opened his door, and walked out to survey the damage. There was none. He had taken out one of the ubiquitous reflector posts that decorated the side of the road, but somehow his vehicle had only gathered dirt and grass inside the rim of the front driver’s side wheel. No scuffs, no scratches, no dents; nothing.
Nik remembered the reaction that his girlfriend at the time had—the same one who would tell you about how annoying his silence in the face of discomfort was—as she rose from the passenger’s side, and met him in front of the vehicle.
“What the fuck?!” she screamed, as she rained down blows upon his shoulders and chest, Nik putting his arms up in a lame defense. “I fucking *asked* you if you were too tired to drive!” The voice was surely piercing the thin veil of the car’s windshield. He felt his friends staring, judging his relationship to be frail and poor, which to Nik meant that *he* was frail and poor. Nik didn’t reply to her, but let her finish and got back into the car, started it, and with everyone voicing their disbelief, he got back on to the highway and drove home.

This memory flashed back at Nik as he drifted, and woke, and drifted and woke. His numbing cycle was broken when Harris broke in, loudly, so as to beat out the competing engine and air hitting the windshield.

“So, Nik, I know the semester’s over, but what what do you do when it’s not?” Harris asked, briefly taking his otherwise determined, focus eyes off of the road.

Nik thought for a second, taking the question more broadly than Harris had meant it. His mind flashed back to a semester of skipped classes, sleepless nights, late mornings, and drunken wanderings around the outskirts of campus. He must have been in and out of 25 parties throughout the semester, but he wagered that no one at a single one would recognize him as having been there. Anyone who had met him throughout the semester would have noted his distant eyes, looking through any acquaintance to some distant object on the horizon, some object that either brought dread or salvation—it wasn’t quite clear which. Snapping out of his brief flashback, he stuttered and answer, “um, Religious Studies.” He had adopted this major after taking a class from the chair of the department, Dr. Wolstencraft. Her enthusiasm for each and every major religion, as the class surveyed them from a high altitude, was not like anything he’d seen before. She practically pirouetted from one end of the large lecture hall to the other, stopping only to make marks on the whiteboard. It took exactly two sessions of the course for Nik to become infatuated with her. He found himself simultaneously learning about Jain devotees’ reluctance to walk, lest they step on and harm insects, and wondering about what was in Dr. Wolstencraft’s coffee cup. What did she order? A latte? An americano? Maybe just a black coffee? No, she at least had a shot of espresso; she wouldn’t merely order black coffee—at least not in Nik’s limited and specific fantasy.

As Nik had replied, Harris grinned, as if he had won a wager with an invisible passenger in the back seat. “I’ll resist the question you’ve probably already had to answer—*what do you plan to do with that?*—and ask you a more respectful one. Have you uncovered the truth yet?”

For the first time in perhaps 4 days—maybe longer—Nik cracked a smile, ever so slightly. A question like this, though tongue-in-cheek, was rare. There was something about Harris’s tone that Nik picked up on immediately. It was the question of a genuinely interested party, one who understood. It was thinly veiled with fake sarcasm—a kind of flimsy defense against the well-known disdain that Nik saw for genuine wonder in the rest of the world. At that moment, despite the barrage of cold air blasting from the dashboard, Nik felt a little warmth.
“Yeah, I think...at least part of it,” Nik answered slowly, and staring straight ahead, as if he was grappling with the words hopping off of the cliff of his lips like enthusiastic lemmings.

Again, Harris grinned; this time a little wider than last. “Oh yeah?” he asked as if winding up to toss a perfectly-placed slow pitch toward Nik’s waiting bat, “What did you find?” He turned to Nik, as a camera would turn to a perspiring Richard Nixon, after he was posed an interesting question during a televised debate.

Nik continued to stare ahead, as if breaking his gaze on the road would break his connection with what he was thinking about. “That’s the problem. I can’t really put it into words. It’s like…” he stumbled a bit, “...it’s just a kind of feeling about connection, about identity, about how it may seem like there are separations, divisions, and opposition,” and his stumbling clip-clopped into a slightly less sloppy run, “but those things are just one level of reality. And we can’t really know reality like that—at that high level—because then we’d lose our part in it, we’d become…like…”

“Gods?” Harris chimed in, looking over with the faintest hint of a smile slinking its way onto his face. After a slight delay, he  said warmly, “Don’t try to put it into words. I once heard that words are to truth what a glass jar is to a butterfly—constraining, and in the end, fatal.”

For the first time, Nik looked over at Harris. Harris’s eyes were already back on the road.

“Reality is a funny thing, Nik. Nothing is just what it is. Everything is something else.” Harris said in a strangely unwavering voice, beginning to look over at Nik. “There is more depth than we often give reality credit for."

Nik looked away as Harris’s eyes almost met his, hoping that Harris didn’t notice his dodging evasive maneuver. As he looked down at something—the floor mat, his shoes, something on the floor, he said quietly. “Hm,” kind of laughing internally, but only audibly offering up that word. 

As he looked up, he saw the bend in the road that signified the turn onto the unnamed road of Andrik’s farm. “This is it, here, turn onto this road,” Nik said quickly, pointing at the aforementioned weeping willow tree.

“Mm, so it is,” Harris said softly, as if he was fully anticipating the turn.

The car turned, and the familiar crunch of gravel hit Nik’s ears, bringing back memories of the mid-summers of his youth. The whole road was gravel around the area, but for whatever reason, there was something about that turn, combined with the gravel on that section of road that sounded different. This time, it was strangely both comforting and colored with a slight dread of uncertainty. What had Nik resolved himself into here? Here he was, far from anywhere, recovering from what must have been a dress rehearsal of dying, and he had no idea what he was going to do. 

The car pulled up to the main house, which looked pretty much exactly as it did the last time Nik visited—some amount of years ago that he couldn’t quite recall. Harris, sensing that this was the destination, slowly pressed on the brakes, and the car slowed to a stop, leaving a cloud of gravel behind them. 
“I’m assuming this is where I leave you,” Harris said, shifting the car into park.

“Uh, yeah,” Nik replied, almost as if caught off guard. “Uh, thanks,” followed clumsily out of his mouth. He grabbed his suitcase, and began his exit from his unexpected chariot. 

But Harris’ hand moved swiftly and—with an ever-so-slight grasp—stopped Nik suddenly. He spoke. “You’re welcome, Sir Nik,” he said, mimicking a solemn and respectful bow with just his head. “May you continue to straddle that line between mere human and god.”

With that, Nik slipped his arm out from under Harris’s grasp, pulled the handle on the door to open it, and stepped out of the vehicle.



The humid outside air hit Nik’s face like a slap. He looked around at the area of the farm. It was as if time had stopped the day he left the place almost ten years ago. The main house was still there, with the cellar door replete with ivy climbing all around it, yet curiously avoiding the door itself. The ivy continued to climb up the pale yellow brick side of the house, thickening between the dining room and kitchen windows. It continued to thicken, and then spread out over the second story windows of the bedrooms. 

The front porch remained in decent condition, clearly worn, but sound. The wooden boards of the floor were painted a very pale yellow—almost off-whited, but tinged with the color of the morning sun’s first peek over the horizon. The railing was white, with simple decor, and separated where a few stairs connected the porch to the dirt path leading from the gravel road to the house. The porch swing, unpainted, and held up by rope that may have seen action during the Civil War, remained—swinging a bit in the slight wind that broke through the hot, humid air. The sound of small wind chime broke through the air. 

Across from the house, on the other side of the gravel road, turned path, was the main barn. It too was in decent condition, its red paint worn in places, but the wood underneath still strong and sturdy. The wood-shingled roof was aged, but had the feel of good craftsmanship to it. Each shingle had its own distinct shape and size, but they somehow formed a pattern together. The sliding barn door was slightly open, allowing sun to peek in and illuminate a bit of the hay that lay on the floor.

Further down the gravel path was the storage shed, and old wooden building which had been gray from age since well before Nik had stepped foot on the farm for the first time. It too had a wood-shingled roof, but it was less remarkable than the barn’s. It’s swinging doors were shut, and there was a spot near the back end facing the road that had been patched up with some plywood.

The path ended at the grain silo, and its attached small barn. There was a broken down tractor in front of the one on the left, a tractor that may very well have grown roots by now. The rust looked as if it was the initial condition of the steel panels at the time it was built. It had that perfect uniform orange color to it, the uniformity that only years and years of rain, snow, sleet, fog, and everything in between could provide. The silo was stout-looking,  seeming shorter than it should be for how wide it was. It was made of large bricks that were textured to look more like stones, but were far too uniform in their squareness to have been mined and arranged in their natural shape. The dome top was bronze in color, and strangely un-oxidizied by the years—the same as it had been a decade ago, and likely decades before that. The attached barn was small, but sturdy-looking. It was a pale blue-gray color, almost like it was a black-and-white photographed version of some other vibrant colors, robbed of their impact by they limitations of the film.

The farm as a whole was the very definition of rustic. It looked as if it breathed in dirt and gravel, and breathed out crisp country air. From the second story of the farmhouse, one could see for miles across the plains, right across into Canada, which lay only about 1,000 feet north of the farm. Andrik’s property itself was only about 100 acres, give or take. It ran horizontally up until about 20 yards before the border. Old, tall trees littered the property; willows, sycamores, oaks, pines, firs. On the south side, a daunting row of firs served as a makeshift fence to separate the Presiel farm from its southern neighbors, whose name escaped Nik at the moment.

Over the years, the farmland served as soil mostly for feed—corn, barley, and various grasses. It made him a decent amount of money, and provided a root for the Presiel family in America.  For Nik, as he walked down the gravel path to the house, perhaps it would serve as a place to plant new roots for himself—existential roots. He had, for the last 20 or so years, been a formless, shapeless being. He was white, straight, middle-class, and young. His identity couldn’t come from oppression, from a struggle, from tragedy; it would have to come from something else. He felt as if so many of his peers were beginning to leave their seats next to him, hearing the song that pulled them to dance and sway toward whatever life it was they felt impassioned to lead. Nik, on the other hand, hadn’t heard anything at all. Perhaps here, cut off from all of the noise and the movement of his usual world, Nik could hear whatever it was he was supposed to hear, and follow the sound to where he was supposed to go.
