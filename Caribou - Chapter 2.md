##Chapter 2



The farmhouse at Uncle Andrik’s place was tired and old. It blended in nicely with all of the other farmhouses that whizzed by Nik’s window on his train ride through the Minnesota plains. Nik hadn’t taken the train anywhere for a long time, and on this ride, he begun to wonder why—as it seemed strangely comforting. Perhaps it was the rhythmic sound of the wheels on the tracks, as they skipped over the ties—*ca chunk - ca chunk - ca…*

 The train was an old one, and moved and swayed in a way that revealed its long life. *These seats have probably seen a lot of asses*, Nik thought to himself, almost smirking at his little internal jest. This was a long ride, on the Far North Transit line, running along Route 59—through Fergus Falls, Detroit Lakes, Thief River Falls, Karlstad, Halma, and terminating in Lancaster, where all sleeping bodies would be awoken and shooed off to wherever it was that they were going. From Lancaster, it was quite a haul—25 miles or so down County Road 4, to be exact. Though this was not the kind of thing that Nik would usually welcome, he had coached himself into thinking that this would be good for him. He’d red all kinds of stuff about mindfulness, about walks, and their spiritual benefits. It seemed only logical that walking 25 miles to a secluded farm on the northern border of the country would provide ample opportunity to reconnect with himself, and with the world. After all, it was May, the weather was great—in the 70s, though cloudy and gray—but it was not the sort of thing that would kill him. He imagined himself making his way to the farm, pumping fresh cold water from the well, and collapsing into a haystack, with a sense of accomplishment that had become so foreign to him over the past few years. Whatever feeling this was, it smelled almost like optimism. This could be, no, *would* be a new beginning. I *had *to be. 
 
If ever there was a place to really begin anew, to really sweep all of the clutter off of the table, Nik thought to himself, Uncle Andrik’s farm would be it. It was quite literally in the middle of nowhere, a mere two hundred or so feet from the US/Canada border in unincorporated Caribou, MN. Andrik Presiel was Nik’s great-grandfather’s younger brother. He, along with Nik’s great-grandfather, Bogdan, and their parents (Nik’s great-great grandparents), had emigrated from somewhere in what was still part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire just prior to World War I. As the story goes, the Presiels arrived at Ellis Island in New York, and managed gain passage on a series of boxcars, eventually making it out to Minnesota, and Caribou in particular. Andrik claimed, and challenges to this claim were rebuffed at many a family gathering, that his father had beaten a Romani man in an impromptu wrestling challenge outside of a tavern back in “the old country”. The Romani man, in an attempt to disprove the stereotype attributed to his people, bestowed upon Andrik’s father a piece of paper, folded many times over. As the family legend went, the folded paper was a map to a piece of land in the very northern point of Minnesota, along with a title to the land there. Andrik contended, until his death 2 years ago, that his father took that as a sign, and packed up the family with a single-minded vision to escaping to America, and to claim the land that he had rightfully won, wrestling a drunken gypsy and pinning him in the mud. The map and title were supposedly lost to the years, and as Uncle Andrik’s attorney attested at the time his estate was settled, the small 50 acre farm was the property of the Presiel family, with no prior owners listed in the state’s records.

Nik was sketchy on many of the details, because he only remembered the mental pictures he carried home from his trips to Andrik’s farm. But there were enough trips in Nik’s childhood that he knew he would begin to recognize the scenery as he neared the hamlet of Caribou, and his uncle’s hideaway. Caribou isn’t a town, as much as it is just an unincorporated area on the far northern end of Minnesota, just East from the state’s border with North Dakota. The official population of the township is 44 people, give or take those who—like Nik—were merely staying a short while.  In a way, Caribou is not so much a place where people live, so much at is it a place that they pass through. They may stop because their vehicle breaks down, or because they wish to hang around and see the plains below them from the higher points, where the elevation breaks 1,000 ft above sea level. But only a select few, just over 40 people if you believe the census, really call that land in Caribou “home”. Everyone else is usually on their way to one of two places. Such was the fate of this small little township.


The train continued to lumber along the impossibly old tracks, as the flat land of the Minnesota plains continued its monotonous window show to the few passengers on the train. The show was broken only by trees, here and there, as if to remind those watching that they weren’t going over the same land over and over. Nik thumbed the handle of his suitcase as he almost fell into a trance from the show put on by the plains out the window. 

Normally, Nik would have kept his mind distracted by looking at his phone, reading a book, or listening to music, something other than sitting with his thoughts. But he had made it his mission, for at least the period from this May to the end of August—when he’d be expected to report back to school—to live an almost *Walden*-like existence in Caribou, bringing few worldly possessions and living simply. He left his phone, his watch, headphones, books and magazines, everything, back at his apartment on campus. His rent had been paid up through the end of the lease in August, and he could pick up his possessions when he came back through town—whenever that would be. He brought with him only a small, old wood and burlap suitcase, one which he had found in his parents’ attic years ago. He packed two pairs of pants, three shirts (two t-shirts, and one button-down long-sleeve shirt), three pairs of underwear, three pairs of socks, and one pair of shoes. After stuffing that down, he had room for one book, which is all he would want to allow himself, given his newly adopted mission. He scanned his densely packed bookshelf for something that would fit his state of mind. His eyes stopped at one book in particular, whose spine read *Bardo Thodol*.

As he reached for the book, he recalled how he had come to acquire it, on a whim, really. It was the end of the fall semester, just this past December. Nik had made his way across campus, through the biting wind and accompanying snow flurry, to turn in the final paper of the Fall semester, sliding it under his professor’s office door at the last possible minute. The office was all the way up on the 9th floor of a 10 floor building that towered over the other small two and three story academic buildings around it. It was like a warehouse for the non-STEM academics. They were piled on top of one another in this miniature high-rise, in order of decreasing relevance—Philosophy and Religious Studies being on the ninth floor; the tenth and highest floor was storage. Nik had stayed up the entire night, trying to compose something resembling an essay about Plato’s theory of the Forms, and rushed off to print a copy and discreetly slide it under Prof. Desjardin’s door, as if cautiously offering up a sacrifice to a hungry and ornery beast. As he turned away from his instructor’s office, and made his way back to the elevator, he saw a bookshelf in the hallway, between two offices. Above it hung a piece of printer paper, with some meeting minutes or other unimportant content on the back of it. It had been made into a sign, complete with an arrow pointing down the bookshelf, which now held one single book. It read ‘Free, Take One!’ Nik figured he would do his part and finish off the process of emptying this retired bookshelf. The sole tome occupying the top shelf was the aforementioned *Bardo Thodol*, which Nik quickly put into his messenger bag, without so much as glancing at what the contents of the book were. It wasn’t until a few days later, in a buzzed and playful mood with a few bottles of beer at his feet, that he flipped through the book and realized what it was. He had heard of it before, and if he remembered correctly, his high school had put on a stage version of the book, which he had—of course—skipped. It seemed to him like the kind thing that one ought to read if they wished to become worldly, so it found itself counted among the few possessions that Nik chose to accompany him on this retreat.

With those few items stuffed into his old suitcase—burlap stretched over wood frame—Nik ran his middle finger along the underside of the leather handle, feeling the contrast of the cold brass rivets against the seemingly warm and soft leather. He eyed the cabin, seeing only one woman in the front. She appeared to be sleeping, her head bobbing rhythmically along with the *ca-chunk ca-chunk *of the car’s wheels. The car smelled old, as if each year added its own notes to maroon upholstered seats and royal blue carpet that ran the aisle. It was the transportation equivalent of a cast iron skillet, keeping a bit of the essence, the flavor of each group of passengers as they filed in and filed out, up and down the land of 10,000 lakes.

Nik raised his head and eyes upward, toward the ceiling. Thick, shiny brass trim outlined an impossibly long rectangular piece of leather that went from one end of the train car to the other. The rivets of the car’s body itself were brass and amazingly unvarnished throughout the sides and top of the car. The brass must have been too slick for the years to stick to, Nik joked to himself. As his eyes dropped from the car’s ceiling down to the door on the end of the car facing him, his eyes met a passenger entering the car. The stranger was fairly nicely dressed. He sported a dark charcoal gray suit, which appeared to have the slightest windowpane check on it, in a slightly lighter gray color. His shirt was white, and collar opened, with no tie to be found. His hair was short and very dark, but somewhat messy, in a very casual and comfortable way. He had a very casual air about him, as if he would be comfortable pretty much anywhere.

 Nik, a bit surprised, averted his eyes away from the stranger and moved them out the window, as if they had only accidentally come to rest upon the new passenger on their way to look once again at the monotone plains rushing by. Any tactics to try to fool the stranger were in vain, as he—in what had to be a purposeful breaking of every law of mass transportation ettiquite—took a seat in the row across the aisle from Nik. It coul have been worse; he could have sat right next to Nik, and perhaps he would have, Nik thought to himself, had Nik not been sitting as close to the aisle as he was. 
The stranger was loud as he sat down, at least compared to the quiet to which Nik had become accustomed. He had only two things with him that Nik could see: a jet black briefcase, where even the clasps and combination dials were black—albeit shiny black, and a charcoal gray trenchcoat, or some sort of coat, folded over the arm carrying the case. He (loudly, of course) placed the coat beside him on the seat, moving even closer the aisle, and thus closer to Nik. He placed the briefcase on his knees, and placed his hands (again way more loudly than seemed necessary) on top of the case. As the stranger began to look up, Nik covertly turned his gaze back out the window, to the reruns of the great plains rushing by; he hadn’t missed anything since he last checked in. By then, he could tell that the stranger was looking at him. This brought on a tremendous urge to look back, which was perfectly counterbalanced by the burning desire not to engage this stranger, as his eyes were no doubt transfixed on Nik with exactly that intention. He could just feel it.

“Not a lot to see out there.” The stranger butted in, cordially.

Nik turned back toward the stranger, as if he hadn’t even noticed him before he spoke. He turned on his best Midwestern courteous smile and said, trying to act in kind, “No, but it’s strangely comforting.”

“I know what you mean. I have ridden this train more times than I can count, and I still end up looking out the window.” He began laughing as he reported “I swear, no matter what I bring along to read, write, or even if I’m intent on just trying to sleep, I end up looking out the window. I guess it’s kind of like, the more you try to avoid something, the more difficult it is to escape.” His face turned a bit as he finished, as if he’d just taken his first sip of the morning coffee and it was cold. “I’m sorry, I’ve totally jumped into a soliloquy on absolutely nothing, and I didn’t even consider whether you were just looking to be with your thoughts. Think nothing of it, I’ve got work to do, and I ought to just get right to it.” He turned back to his briefcase, and began turning the combination dials to open it.
It was at that moment that Nik realized that the train had slowed rapidly since he spotted the stranger. It was now crawling along, at a speed no faster than a medium jog. Nik’s initial disposition toward solitude lifted a bit, as he felt a little bad that he must’ve made the stranger feel unwelcome. “No, no, I um...I didn’t mean to seem like I was trying to brush you off. It’s just uh, I’ve kind of zoned out.”

“Haha,” the stranger laughed knowingly, “I’ve been there, friend. I guess I was just trying to avoid my work, and I figured the only other person I’ve seen on the train in a while might be a present a good opportunity to distract myself.”

Nik furrowed his eyebrows a bit, as he asked “Oh, so you didn’t just get on the train?”

The stranger smiled comfortingly. “No, no, I’ve been on for a while, since back in...well you know what, we’ve gotten awfully far in this conversation without knowing each other’s names. I’m kind of weird, in that I like to use people’s names when I speak to them. It’s something I’ve picked up in my job over the years, and it really helps. So...”
He held out his hand and as he spoke his name, the air brakes of the train hissed just loud enough that the stranger’s voice was slightly contested by the sound. Nik was quite sure that the stranger’s name was Harris.

“Good to meet you, Harris,” Nick said, again with his courteous smile. “I’m Nik.”

“A pleasure to meet you, Nik,” Harris replied, putting his left hand over Nik’s right hand as they shook. “Nik, I hope I don’t offend you when I guess that you’re a student,” Harris said with a slight grin.

Nik shifted a bit uncomfortably  in his seat, adjusting his posture so as to appear a bit less like a student. “Yeah, is it that apparent?” he asked half-laughing.

Harris chuckled playfully and put out his hand, as if to manually assuage any possible self-consciousness. “Don’t take it the wrong way, I just know that look—the look of a young student, whose entire being has been sapped by a taxing semester.” He folded his hands on top of his case, as if this conversation was the only thing he had to do today. “Are you on your way home, then?”

“Not quite,” Nik replied looking down at his shoes. “I’m kind of in between homes, if you know what I mean.” And in a way, he was. Nik’s parents were trying to sell their home, which was the house that Nik lived in from the time he was 3 until he headed out the University. For the first few months of his freshman year, he traveled back home nearly every other weekend. He would spend Friday and Saturday with his friends that were still in high school, and the few other friends who were back home from other schools. He would crash each night back in his childhood bedroom, and by Sunday he would become saturated with a feeling of immense sentimentality. It happened nearly every Sunday afternoon. He would happen across some tchotchke in some hidden corner of his room, and find himself pulled down a rabbit hole of memories, the aftermath of which was always a painful reluctance to drive back to school. His departure from home on Sunday went from the afternoons, to the evenings, to late enough at night that his parents would ask him whether he was leaving at all. He spent that winter break at home, and began to realize that as much jubilation as he experienced at home each weekend, that place could not continue to be his *home* so long as he was looking to build his own life. Acquaintances in his dorm and classes were staying back at school each weekend, going to parties, hanging out, and putting together the building blocks of memories. Nik felt himself moving further away from those on his floor, his roommate, and others in his classes—and it began to ferment into a loneliness, one that continued to grow on through the night that landed him in the hospital. 
From time to time, his roommate or those in the dorms would ask why he went home nearly every weekend, and he would always make up an excuse. He blamed his parents, relatives that didn’t exist, friends that were supposedly in for just a short time, and others. But at bottom, the reason was simple: Nik really was between homes, and was struggling with it. He was sure that he had to build his own life, away from his parents and friends, on his own, with new college friends and socialization that did not depend on inside jokes and a shared history spanning back to grade school. He was certain that he had to form a social network to help him go somewhere—*do *something, once the University handed him his degree and hurried him off to the real world. But at the same time, his heart ached at the thought of leaving that well-worn comfort of home. So he began forcing himself to stay on campus each weekend, and returned home only a few times during the Spring semester. He eventually fell in with three acquaintances, with which he split rent on a four bedroom apartment just across from the heart of campus. Jeff, Derek, and Javaad were easy enough to get along with, but Nik found himself wandering off alone quite a bit. He just never felt that *click* wherein one latches on, and connects the cars of friendship, as it were. After the first semester of his sophomore year passed in that apartment, it became clear to Nik that no, this new ‘home’ was not, after all, home to him. All of this seemed to receive a bold punctuation mark as the stranger asked him about home. Perhaps he was heading home. After all, this place would be just as much a home as any other place.

Harris looked at Nik with what could only be interpreted as a truly sympathetic look, as if he himself had once been a modern, middle-American nomad. “I know what you mean. You’re what...20?” he asked, squinting, as if that would help him better use whatever faculty was in charge of guessing the age of strangers.

“Yeah, I’m 20,” Nik replied in a tone much like how one would admit to being guilty of the crime in question at an indictment. 

“20 can be an interesting age,” Harris said, attempting to summon a comforting grin. “You have enough years behind you to think you might know what you’re doing—where you’re going, but ultimately, you don’t have nearly enough to go on yet.”

Nik thought about that for a second. It was a strangely reassuring proclamation. He did find himself often feeling like he *should* know what he was going to be, and where he was going—both literally and figuratively. Perhaps that assumption was neither well-supported nor at all helpful. Still, for whatever reason, Nik had always held himself to a higher standard, existentially speaking. He felt himself to be on track for something, doing each mundane little action, making numerous mistakes, and suffering fits of despair, but all in service of some abstract and distant profundity. He had this reassurance that he would live profoundly—not now, but *one day*. He had the requisite reservoir of passion, he merely needed a place to unleash it, and so far, he hadn’t found it.

“If you’re offended by this, please do let me know,” Harris continued. “But if you don’t mind, where are you headed?”

“Caribou,” Nik offered, not entirely sure if he should have, as the word escaped the border of his lips. And yet, there was something about this stranger that telegraphed the opposite of a threat, as if this man was hell-bent on doing good.

Harris chuckled sharply, but stopped himself by placing his hand over his mouth, as if keeping in a loud belch. “I’m sorry, I really don’t mean to laugh. I just knew you were going to say that, that’s all.”

“Am I wearing it that prominently?” Nik inquired, flirting ever so lightly with a fed-up tone, still not strongly enough that his normal over-courteousness couldn’t tame it.

“Yes, kind of,” Harris said along with another escaping chuckle. “You have that look of a young man who wants to push the envelope of enlightenment to *just* the edge, but probably no further.” As he finished his sentence, he took out what appeared to be a coin purse. “But don’t sell yourself short. You have come a lot farther than you think. I can see it in your eyes. Just because you have not physically crossed the globe, that does not mean that you haven’t *been* places—it doesn’t mean you haven’t earned your anguish.”

Nik fidgeted a little as Harris adopted his unsolicited sermon-like tone, but Harris either did not pick up on it, or felt that it did not deserve acknowledgment. 

Harris, holding his newly revealed accessory, leaned closer to Nik, breaking the imaginary barrier provided by the aisle. “Nik, I have met a lot of people in my time here, and I don’t think I’ve ever met any person that felt as if they had gotten it all right, that they sucked all of the proverbial milkshake out of the bottom of life’s cup. You will always leave something at the bottom of the cup. You will always be missing some opportunity, you will always be leaving something on *some *table. No amount of soul-searching, calculation, or prayer will prevent that from happening.”

Nik had never really encountered someone unloading with this kind of sincerity that was sober and had not just finished reading Kierkegaard for the first time. “You may have a point there,” he finally settled on saying, politely.

Harris smiled and retreated a bit, sensing Nik’s discomfort. “I don’t mean to make you feel uncomfortable, Nik. I just...well, I guess I often feel like I’m not where I *should* be, and whenever I see people with it lingering around them, I feel the need to convince them and me. Look, when it comes down to it, you can relocate all you want, but your life follows you, and you have to make sure that with a companion like that, you’re on good terms with each other.” 
He opened his coin purse and began fingering through it, clearly looking for something. As it became clear that he wasn’t finding what he was searching for, he closed the purse and put it back in his pocket. He looked up at Nik, with a look on his face that seemed to say he wanted to shift back to more standard, everyday tone. “I’m going to skedaddle here, but before I do, do you happen to have a dollar?”

Nik took pains not to telegraph his surprise that this man who had basically bursted into an otherwise quiet train car and tossed a dense soliloquy at him was now hitting him up for money. He quickly put his hand in his right pocket and took out his wallet, he then dug down to the bottom of his pocket. He knew it was a fool’s errand. He never carried cash on him, and did this dance merely as a formality, to show this stranger that he meant well. However, strangely enough, at the bottom of his deep jeans pocket, his middle finger bumped up against what felt like a coin. Conveying the usual strain that one does when they attempt the dexterity of grasping an object in their pant pocket while seated, he grabbed the coin and pulled it out. It took all that he could muster to keep himself from uttering *no way*, but he was absolutely thinking it. Right in his right hand, staring him in the face, was a one-dollar coin. Nik could not remember the last time he even *saw* one of these, let alone possessed one. He couldn’t imagine how it would have found its way into his jeans pocket. He looked at it one last time and offered it up to Harris. “Uh, here you go,” he said somewhat excitedly, enthused to have been able to help, despite the stranger’s quasi-intrusion.

Harris smiled a warm smile as he took the coin from Nik. “Thank you,” he said in a very sincere and almost sacramental tone, as if receiving a mere dollar coin from a new acquaintance on a train were something more than just a small social happenstance. “I’m glad you found that. Now, I hate to rush off, because of how that must seem, but I *promise* you that I’m not a con-man, and I will make sure you’re repaid.”
With that, he got up, grabbed his accessories, and walked down the aisle toward the front of the train. As he did, the train’s hydraulic hiss pierced the quiet that had settled in the car, and the train began slowly moving. Nik, perhaps exhausted from the past few days, perhaps relieved that this somewhat awkward interaction was over, laid his head against the back of his seat, and drifted off to sleep.
