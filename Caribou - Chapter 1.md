##Chapter 1


Nik awoke suddenly, with that terrible feeling of not knowing where he was. There were dim lights, intermittent beeping, and the smell of vinegar and...meatloaf? Maybe not meatloaf, but something just as “down-home”. As the cobwebs of sleep lifted, Nik came to realize that he was in a hospital. 

*Did I check myself in?* He asked himself cautiously. 

He probed his recent memory; nothing. The last thing he remembered was the sound of the train rolling by. He was walking, yeah that’s right, he was walking along the street on the way to his apartment, the train rattling by the tracks across the street—horn tooting randomly.Perhaps he remembered fumbling for his keys? Yes, definitely, he dropped his keys (a not unusual event) and spouted some generic curse. Then he picked them up, thumbed through the keys until he found the correct one, and put it in the lock, turning it, and simultaneously turning the doorknob and pushing the door open. He also remembered the smell of a pizza long-ago cooked, and more sadly, long-ago eaten. He remembered meandering through the living room, bypassing the TV with a game of something paused, giving off piercing blue light throughout the otherwise dark apartment. 

His internal detective work was interrupted by a slight knock at the door, and the quick entrance of someone, someone who clearly did not mean the knock sincerely—since they entered before the sound had even reached Nik’s ears.

 “Mr….”

“Presiel.” Nik blurted almost involuntarily.

“Thanks…” the intruder said slightly surprised. “Well, that’s a pretty good sign.”

“What, that I can remember my last name?” Nik quipped a bit sarcastically.

The man, who by now Nik surmised was a doctor, looked up from the chart he was holding. He looked Nik square in the eyes, in a way that Nik was not quite used to at this point in his 20 years of life. He took a short breath before saying—in a voice that was soaked with measure and confidence— “Frankly, yes. With the amount of Clonazepam, Pethidine, and Alcohol you ingested, remembering your name would usually be a Herculean task at this point.”

It hit him like a ton of bricks. The pale green pills, the pale blue pills, the bottle of gin with a name he didn’t know, or didn’t care to remember. They were all there, on his desk, neatly arranged, and he remembered thinking something like *let’s just get rid of all this*. But it wasn’t quite clear what “all this” was referring to.

“Mr…” the doctor started, but smiled, taking a conservative course of verbal action “Nik. Was it your goal to end your life two nights ago?”

Nik was unsure how to answer. *Was it? Was that night it?* He thought to himself. How could he even begin to judge what he was thinking that night? And was that *really* two nights ago? He broke the silence of pause: “I am pretty sure it wasn’t.”

With an unexpected lack of doubt, the doctor closed his chart, looked Nik in the eyes, and said. “It’s still night, and I’d like you to get some more sleep—try to align yourself with the rhythm of the day. Someone will be in in the morning, to check on you. I’d advise you be honest with them—please.”

Nik nodded, but didn’t say anything. He felt himself getting more and more tired, and based on what he did remember, knew that his body would need all the sleep it could get to recover from what he had done to it.



Nik awoke to the sound of shuffling feet in his room. Someone was moving around rhythmically, almost as if dancing to a silent song. As he scrubbed the sleep away from his eyes, he noticed that though the sun was shining into the room, the whole room seemed pale, as if the gray clouds that the sun was hiding behind were thicker and more degrading to the sun’s rays than usual. The meditation on color was interrupted by a voice.

“Mr. Presiel?” the voice said, almost singing. “How are you feeling this morning?”

Nik was amazed that the woman had pronounced his name correctly. Not only that, she had pronounced it the way that Nik’s great-grandfather had, in full Slovakian accent, though her accent was obviously non-European, more likely Middle-Eastern.

“Yes,” he said, with as much of a normal voice as he could muster “I’m uh...I feel pretty good.” And, actually, he did feel strangely okay. Last night—or whenever that was—he felt groggy, sluggish, heavy, and his stomach was tying itself into knots viciously. Today was almost the complete opposite. He didn’t feel great, but he felt *okay*, as if he could get up and go walk around.  

“Well, I am glad to hear it.” The soft voice said. Nik was now focused on the source of the voice. It was a woman; tall and strong-looking. She had light gray hair, pale caramel skin, and a face that seemed to be in a constant state of being in between a smile and a completely neutral state. “I think you have had sufficient rest. If you’re feeling up to it, I’d like to talk about your situation.”

Nik froze. He recalled the doctor, or whoever it was, from the previous encounter. He recalled the question he’d been asked, and the fact that he didn’t know quite how to answer it. His sleep hadn’t gained him any more insight into how to answer the question, and surely, this is what his new visitor was hinting at.

“Um, I guess,” Nik began to dribble “but, um...I don’t know if I can give any good answers to your questions.”

The new visitor smiled and looked Nik in the eyes, almost as if she were somehow collecting data from them, as he sat silently. She put her hand on the hospital comforter that lay on top of his leg and said—keeping her smile intact, “I am not going to ask you about what happened. I believe the past is yours to deal with on your own terms, and with whoever’s help you choose to ask for. What I am here to do is to make sure that you’re ready to go.”

“You mean, go home?” Nik asked, with a tinge of anxiety that he was certain escaped into the air of the room.

Again the visitor maintained the smile—that impossible smile, which as the seconds passed, started to almost irritate Nik. Who was she to smile like that, in a place like this, in a situation like this? For all she knew, Nik wanted to die, and had failed in his attempt, and meant to go right back out and do it again, and the blood would presumably be on her hands. She had to be a doctor right? He scanned her torso and saw a nametag on her impossibly white lab coat. *Azrin* it read. Nik decided to use his newfound acquisition to move the conversation along. But before he could, she broke in.

“Mr. Presiel.” She said softly “Where you go is up to you. I would, however, suggest that you do two things.” She held up two fingers, as if to further drive her point home. “I suggest that you take it easy for the immediate future, and that you be somewhere where you know you can have time to be at peace.”

Nik felt a bit defensive. “I really wasn’t trying to kill myself. I just...I just stopped giving a shit for an hour or two.”

Again, the smile. Dr. Azrin waited for Nik to finish his sentence and the calmly said. “Mmm. Perhaps you weren't, but to be perfectly honest with you, that doesn’t really matter now.” As she finished, she kind of raised her eyebrows as she peered into Nik’s eyes. It was strangely comforting.

“I guess.” Nik answered somewhat sheepishly, looking down at his covers. “I mean, in the end, I did something dangerous, and I guess, whatever my thoughts were, I need a break.”

“Mmm.” Dr. Azrin barely let slip as she nodded knowingly. “You can leave whenever you like, I’ve given my authorization. However, I’d like to talk to you again. I’d like to begin a dialogue, if that is okay with you.”

Nik swallowed hard, just the thought of wading through the muck of his emotions over the past few years almost making him naseous. He looked up, as the lump traveled down his esophagus.

“Okay.” He said in a subdued, but sharp offering. “I think I can do that.”

Dr. Azrin smiled, but this smile was a bit different than the previous monotone display.
“Great.” She said curtly “My card is in the bag with your things.” She pointed at a clear vinyl bag on the hospital end table. It held Nik’s jeans, his now off-white undershirt, his thin navy blue sweater, and presumably his wallet, watch, and other personal effects.

With that, she left, stopping only to glance over at the clock, and write something down in a small book that she had been carrying in her hand. Nik decided not to waste any time, and slowly peeled the covers off of his legs. He noticed that he was not hooked up to IVs, and there were no monitors keeping track of his vitals. He guessed that the doctor was right, in that he was free to go. He removed his clothes from the bag, and laid them on the hospital bed. He made a quick project of removing the hosptial gown and speedily throwing on his boxers, jeans, shirt, sweater, socks, and shoes. With the placement of his wallet and watch, he stepped out the door, and made his way down the hall.
He stopped at the nurses’ station, and waited until a young woman turned around. She was striking, and caused Nik to feel as if was about to stagger back and fall over, but he quickly ensured that his feet were both planted firmly on the ground, and began to open his mouth.

“Can I help you?” The woman asked pleasantly.

“Uh, yeah,” nick stuttered, “I um, Is there anything I need to pay, or sign—like insurance stuff, or anything?”

The woman looked down, then quickly looked up. “Nope. Everything has been squared away. You’re good to go.” She shuffled a few pieces of paper out of Nik’s view, and under the desk. “You’ll receive any paperwork at the address in…” she paused as she found the address on a piece of paper “...Caribou.”

“Caribou?” Nik half asked, half assured himself.

“Yes, I have an address in Caribou, Minnesota.” The woman confirmed, and looked up at Nik.

Nik wondered for a second why he would’ve given that address, but as he did, it made perfect sense. His uncle’s old farm was the best place for him to go now, and though he may not have thought of it at any other time, whatever state he was in when he gave that address...well perhaps this was some sort of sign.

“Yeah, that’s right.” Nik replied, with a fresh, manufactured confidence.

The woman smiled at him, and began to turn her body back to the conversation she had left with the other nurses. As she did, she let out a soft farewell, seemingly trying as best she could to straddle the line between sincere well-wishing and invasive presumptuousness.

“Best wishes, Mr. Presiel.” She said.
