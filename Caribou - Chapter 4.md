## Chapter 4

The key to the house was exactly where it had been since Nik was a child: under a loose board under the door mat—an extra layer of protection against whatever breakers-and-enterers would be wandering about in the middle of nowhere. He picked the key up, being careful to replace the board and the mat, aligning the latter with the discolored area of the porch where the door mat protected that small section of the boards on the porch from the elements, year in and year out.

He gazed up at the door. It was a curiously ornate door, darkly stained, solid wood, with a large, square section of leaded glass at the top. The square contained entire sections of colored pieces—reds and blues intermingling with yellows, a well-orchestrated symphony of primary colors playing against complex etchings in the glass. Through it he could see the scrambled light coming through the windows that separated the kitchen from the three-seasons porch. The light began to shimmer and dance—as if it were beckoning Nik to come through the threshold—or as if clouds were passing between it and the open plains. Nik took the cue and turned the key in the door, jiggling it ever so slightly, remembering that in past years a simple turn of the key would not suffice to grant one entry.

The door opened, and the smell of the old house hit Nik instantly. It was a mix somewhere in between woodsy and musky,  the remnants of years of prairie-style home-cooked dinners and autumnal open-window days. It was strangely comforting, considering the past few years of Nik's life had been filled with the smells one normally associates with 4 young men living together—sucking the  marrow out of each between-classes hour, with no time to fret about the details of dish-washing and hygiene.

The entrance to the house featured a long hallway, which ran to the eat-in kitchen, through to the 3-seasons porch. To the right of that halway was the stairs leading up to the bedrooms, and next to that another large, wooden door, whch opened to a room that Nik remembered—though a bit cloudily. It was uncle Andrik's study. Turning to the left-hand side from the entrance there was the dining room, featuring a long wooden table, which appeared to weigh an easy metric ton. It seated 8, and matched the hutch in the corner opposite the wall with the windows looking outside. The dining room led into the kitchen, through a short hallway and butler's station, which currently had a variety of odds and ends scattered upon it. The kitchen was nothing if not spacious. It featured a large, tall cabinet just at the turn from the butler's station. Several large square-shaped cabinets followed that one until the large stove jutted out of the wall, only to give way to more square cabinets, until the hallway from the front door cut off the kitchen, prior to the beginning of the living room. The refrigerator was an old Frigidaire brand—at least 40 years old, if not more—and it hummed with elegance of an old cobwebbed jukebox in the corner of a dive bar. It was situated on the other side of the kitchen, next to two long, huge doors that opened the almost comically large pantry. It is *almost* comical, except that were one to open it, it would be chock full of supplies—provisions for an army of possible northern prairie wanderers, should they grace the seemingly empty house with their presence. In between the fridge and the pantry was a small built-in desk, with a long drawer underneath it, and a matching wooden seat, with a flowery cushion that had surely seen more than 10 different presidential terms pass. Behind that , a few feet in front of the sliding door to the three-seasons porch, rested the kitchen table. It rivaled the behemoth of a dining room table in size, but was noticably smaller—a kind of proud little brother to the other room's eating surface. Three matching seats sat at the table, with one larger, darker wooden seat sitting opposite the peninsula that stretched from the hallway back to the butler's station.
