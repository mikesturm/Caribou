## Chapter 4

The key to the house was exactly where it had been since Nik was a child: under a loose board under the door mat—an extra layer of protection against whatever breakers-and-enterers would be wandering about in the middle of nowhere. He picked the key up, being careful to replace the board and the mat, aligning the latter with the discolored area of the porch where the door mat protected that small section of the boards on the porch from the elements, year in and year out.

He gazed up at the door. It was a curiously ornate door, darkly stained, solid wood, with a large, square section of leaded glass at the top. The square contained entire sections of colored pieces—reds and blues intermingling with yellows, a well-orchestrated symphony of primary colors playing against complex etchings in the glass. Through it he could see the scrambled light coming through the windows that separated the kitchen from the three-seasons porch. The light began to shimmer and dance—as if it were beckoning Nik to come through the threshold—or as if clouds were passing between it and the open plains.

The entrance to the house featured a long hallway, which ran to the eat-in kitchen, through to the 3-seasons porch. To the right of that halway was the stairs leading up to the bedrooms, and next to that another large, wooden door, whch opened to a room that Nik remember—though a bit cloudily. It was uncle Andrik's study. Turning to one's left-hand side from the entrance there was the dining room, featuring a long wooden table, which appeared to weigh an easy metric ton. It seated 8, and matched the hutch in the corner opposite the wall with the windows looking outside. The dining room led to the kitchen, through a short hallway and butler's station, which currently had a variety of odds and ends scattered upon it. The kitchen was spacious,
